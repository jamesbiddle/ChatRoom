# ChatRoom
This chatroom app is designed as a simple introduction to using express/socket.io to build a server-client chatroom.
Only native javascript is used to run the back and frontend.
HTML and CSS stylings are minimal, as the focus is on the javascript aspects.

Currently hosted with Heroku at https://s4schatroom.herokuapp.com
